RWH-Book
========

This repository are notes taken while I am reading ["Real World Haskell"][1] a book wrote by Bryan O'Sullivan, Don Stewart, and John Goerzen.

These notes are only for my own, I don't know if someone is going to find them interesting. My objective is to organize in a way that I could find things like in a cheapsheet. In some way this is an experiment.

Notes
-----

-- ghci -> haskell interactive console

```hashkell
:set prompt "alba> " 	-- change the prompt
(+) 2 3 	-- add the two numbers
[1,2,3] ++ [4,5] 	-- add the two lists
2 /= 3 		-- True
-- exponential
2 ^ 3
-- exponential 
2 ** 2.3
```
